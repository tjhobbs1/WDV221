       <h1>Wind Energy</h1>
       <h4>Information Page</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Wind Power</strong> is the <em>process</em> of creating energy using the power of wind and air flow
           that the earth creates naturally. This wind power is turned into electrical power
           using modern wind turbines.  The wind turbines harness the kinetic energy from the wind
           and turn it into electrical power.  Wind energy is a <em><strong>major</strong></em> job producer for The state of Iowa.

       <ul>
           <li>Wind energy is clean and renewable.</li>
           <li>Large groups of wind turbines are called wind farms.</li>
           <li>Modern wind turbines usually have 3 blades which can reach speeds at the tip of over 320 kph (200 mph).</li>
       </ul>

           Frances Beinecke: 
            <q>Wind and other clean, renewable energy will help end our reliance on fossil fuels and 
               combat the severe threat that climate change poses to humans and wildlife alike.
