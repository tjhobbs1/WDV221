                   <h2>Caring For Your New Dog</h2>
                   <p>Generally speaking, these breeds of dogs are very affectionate, cheerful and playful. Because of their strong 
                       work ethic and desire to please, training an Alaskan puppies should not be difficult. 
                       However, because these dogs have a bit of an independent, stubborn streak, Alaskan dog 
                       training should entail loads of motivation, consistency and the gentle guidance of positive 
                       reinforcement training.</p>
                    <p>These dogs generally love everyone. They are also good with children. Because Alaskan Dog are pack animals, 
                        they work well with each other and are good with other dogs. At the same time, because of their wolf ancestry, 
                        they can't be trusted with smaller animals, including cats.</p>
                    <p>Because of their high sociability, they make poor watchdogs. You will rarely hear this dog bark unless it's 
                        for a very good reason.</p>

                    <h2>Housebreaking</h2>
                    <p>
                            Housebreaking the Alaskan puppy is not an easy process; however, it's facilitated by the fact that these dogs 
                            love to spend so much time outdoors. Also, just as other Spitz-type dogs, an Alaskan puppy has the 
                            tendency to be fastidiously clean.
