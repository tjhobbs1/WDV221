<p>1. Define a String variable called schoolName and assign it a value of DMACC.</p>

			<script type="text/javascript">
				//1.
				 let schoolName = "DMACC";

				 //We are declaring the variable schoolName and assigning the string "DMACC" to it
			</script>

<p>2. Define a String variable called courseName and assign it a value of WDV221 Intro Javascript</p>

			<script type="text/javascript">
				 //2.
				 let courseName = "WDV221 Intro to Javascript";

				 //We are declaring the variable courseName and assigning the string "WDV221 Intro to Javascript" to it
			</script>

<p>3. Define a Numeric variable called testScore and assign it a value of 100.00. </p>

			<script type="text/javascript">
				//3.
				 let testScore = 100.00

				 //We are declaring the variable testScore and assigning the float value 100.00
			</script>

<p>4. Define a Numeric variable called courseGrade. Do not give it a value.</p>

			<script type="text/javascript">
				//4.
				 let courseGrade;
				 //We are declaring the variable courseGrade but not assigning a value, so it will have a value of undefined.
			</script>

<p>5. Define a Boolean variable called courseCompleted. Give it a value of false.</p>

			<script type="text/javascript">
				//5.
				 let courseCompleted = false;

					//We are declaring the variable courseCompleted and assigning the Boolean of false.

			</script>

<p>Display the value of all the variables in their own paragraphs below. </p>
		<p>
			<script type="text/javascript">
			//Display the value of all the variables in their own paragraphs below.
					document.write(schoolName);

					//Displaying the variable schoolName via the write function.
			</script>
		</p>

		<p>
			<script type="text/javascript">
			//Display the value of all the variables in their own paragraphs below.
					document.write(courseName);

					//Displaying the variable courseName via the write function.
			</script>
		</p>

		<p>
			<script type="text/javascript">
			//Display the value of all the variables in their own paragraphs below.
					document.write(testScore);

				//Displaying the variable testScore via the write function.
			</script>
		</p>

		<p>
			<script type="text/javascript">
			//Display the value of all the variables in their own paragraphs below.
					document.write(courseGrade);

					//Displaying the variable courseGrade via the write function.
			</script>
		</p>

		<p>
			<script type="text/javascript">
			//Display the value of all the variables in their own paragraphs below.
					document.write(courseCompleted);

					//Displaying the variable courseCompleted via the write function.
			</script>

		</p>




<p>Display the number of characters in the course name.</p>

			<script type="text/javascript">
				//Display the number of characters in the course name.
					document.write(courseName.length);

					//We are using the String length function to see the total length of the string and then printing it on the screen.
			</script>

<p>Display the course name as all uppercase letters.</p>

			<script type="text/javascript">
				//Display the course name as all uppercase letters.
					document.write(courseName.toUpperCase());

					//We are using the String toUpperCase function to change all the characters of the courseName to all caps.
			</script>
<p>Using the String Object determine if the course name contains the letters WDV?  Look at the String methods. Does one or more of them look inside the variable for specific content?</p>
			<script type="text/javascript">
				let containsWDV = courseName.includes("WDV");
				console.log (containsWDV);
				document.write(containsWDV + ": courseName contains WDV");

				//We are using the String includes method to return a Boolean value.  We are checking to see if the the String contains WDV.
				//It should return true. 
			</script>
