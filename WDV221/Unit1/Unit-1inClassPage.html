        	<p>Not a language but a group of languages working together within the browser to create website applications. Consists of four technologies working together. They each have their own syntax, commands and rules. However they are designed to work together and provide mutual support.</p>
        	<p>HTML - the core technology of ALL websites and web based applications. HTML provides the structure of the page and carries the content and other technologies.</p>
        	<p>CSS - the 'presentation manager' of the web world. Or as some say &quot;make it look good&quot;.</p>
        	<p>Javascript - the client side language that provides for functionality. It makes the web page do things!</p>
        	<p>Document Object Model (DOM) - also known as your browser. This is the program that display the web page based upon the information in the HTML, CSS and Javascript languages. While similar, each browser is slightly different and this can cause problems along the way. </p>
